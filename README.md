jsfs
====

A general-purpose, deduplicating filesystem with a REST interface, jsfs is intended to provide low-level filesystem functions for Javascript applications.  Additional functionality (private file indexes, token lockers, centralized authentication, etc.) are deliberately avoided here and will be implemented in a modular fashion on top of jsfs.

#STATUS
Based on field testing with large storage pools (>1TB) JSFS 4.x features a complete overhaul of the storage pool architecture.  As a result of these changes there are significant performance improvements and storage pool size is no longer constrained by avaliable memory.  Unfortunately some features have been depreciated out of necessity, at least temporarilly (if these features are needed they are still avaliable in the 3.0 release).

The 4.x series server is not compatible with 3.x pools, so a migration utility (`migrate_superblock.js`) has been included in the `tools` directory.

#REQUIREMENTS
* Node.js

#CONFIGURATION
*  Clone this repository
*  Copy config.ex to config.js
*  Create the `blocks` directory (`mkdir blocks`)
*  Start the server (`node server.js`, `npm start`,  foreman, pm2, etc.)

If you don't like storing the data in the same directory as the code (smart), edit config.js to change the location where data (blocks) are stored and restart jsfs for the changes to take effect.

Additional storage locations can be specified to allow the JSFS pool to span physical devices.  In this configuration JSFS will spread the stored blocks evenly across multiple devices (inode files will be written to all devices for redundancy).

It's important to note that configuring multiple storage devices does not provide redundancy to the data stored in the pool.  If a storage device becomes unavaliable, and a file is requested that is composed of blocks on the missing device, the file will be corrupt.  If the device is restored, or the blocks that were stored on the device are added to the remaining device, JSFS will automatically return to delivering the undamaged files.

Future versions of JSFS may include an option to use multiple storage locations for the purpose of redundancy.

#API

##Keys and Tokens
Keys are used to unlock all operations that can be performed on an object stored in JSFS, and objects can have only one key.  With an `access_key`, you can execute all supported HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, DELETE) as well as generate tokens that grant varying degrees of access to the object.

Tokens are more ephemeral, and any number of them can be generated to grant varying degrees of access to an object.  Token generation is described later.

##Parameters and Headers
jsfs uses several parameters to control access to objects and how they are stored.  These values can also be supplied as request headers by adding a leading "x-" and changing "_" to "-" (`access_token` becomes `x-access-token`). Headers are preferred to querystring parameters because they are less likely to collide but both function the same.

###private
By default all objects stored in jsfs are public and will be accessible via any `GET` request.  If the `private` parameter is set to `true` a valid `access_key` or `access_token` must be supplied to access the object.

###access_key
Specifying a valid access_key authorizes the use of all supported HTTP verbs and is required for requests to change the `access_key` or generate `access_token`s.  When a new object is stored, jsfs will generate an `access_key` automatically if one is not specified and return the generated key in the response to a `POST` request.

An `access_key` can be changed by supplying the current `access_key` along with the `replacement_access_key` parameter.  This will cause any existing `access_token`s to become invalid.

###access_token
An `access_token` must be provided to execute any request on a `private` object, and is required for `PUT` and `DELETE` if an `access_key` is not supplied.

####Generating access_tokens
Currently there are two types of `access_token`: durable and temporary.  Both are generated by creating a string that describes what access is granted and then using SHA1 to generate a hash of this string, but the format and use is a little different.

Durable `access_token`s are generated by concatinating an object's `access_key` with the HTTP verb that the token will be used for.

Example to grant GET access:

     "077785b5e45418cf6caabdd686719813fb22e3ce" + "GET"

This string is then hashed with SHA1 and can be used to perform a `GET` request for the object whose `access_key` was used to generate the token.

To make a temporary token for this same object, concatinate the `access_key` with the HTTP verb and the expiration time in epoc format (milliseconds since midnight, 01/01/1970):

     "077785b5e45418cf6caabdd686719813fb22e3ce" + "GET" + "1424877559581"

This string is then hashed with SHA1 and supplied as a parameter or header with the request, along with an additional parameter named `expires` which is set to match the expiration time used above.  When the jsfs server receives the request, it generates the same token based on the stored `access_key`, the HTTP method of the incoming request and the supplied `expires` parameter to validate the `access_token`.

*NOTE: all `access_tokens` can be immediately invalidated by changing an objects `access_key`, however if individual `access_tokens` need to be invalidated a pattern of requesting new, temporary tokens before each request is recommended.*

##POST
Stores a new object at the specified URL.  If the object exists and the `access_key` is not provided, jsfs returns `405 method not allowed`.

###EXAMPLE

     curl -X POST --data-binary @Brinstar.mp3 "http://localhost:7302/music/Brinstar.mp3"

JSFS automatically "namespaces" URL's based on the host name used to make the request.  This makes it easy to create partitioned storage by pointing multiple hostnames at the same JSFS server.  This is accomplished by expanding the host in reverse notation (i.e.: `foo.com` becomes `.com.foo`); this is handled transparrently by JSFS from the client's perspective.

This means that you can point DNS records for `foo.com` and `bar.com` to the same JSFS server and then POST `http://foo.com:7302/files/baz.txt` and `http://bar.com:7302/files/baz.txt` without a conflict.

This also means that `GET http://foo.com:7302/files/baz.txt` and `GET http://bar.com:7302/files/baz.txt` do not return the same file, however if you need to access a file stored via a different host you can reach it using its absolute address (in this case, `http://bar.com:7302/.com.foo/files/baz.txt`).

##GET
Retreives the object stored at the specified URL.  If the file does not exist a `404 not found` is returned.

###EXAMPLE

Request:

     curl -o Brinstar.mp3 http://localhost:730s/music/Brinstar.mp3

Response:
The binary file is stored in new local file called `Brinstar.mp3`.

##PUT
Updates an existing object stored at the specified location.  This method requires authorization, so requests must include a valid `x-access-key` or `x-access-token` header for the specific file, otherwise `401 unauthorized` will be returned.  If the file does not exist `405 method not allowed` is returned.

###EXAMPLE
Request:

     curl -X PUT -H "x-access-key: 7092bee1ac7d4a5c55cb5ff61043b89a6e32cf71"  --data-binary @Brinstar.mp3 "http://localhost:7302/music/Brinstar.mp3"

Result:
`HTTP 206`

*note: `POST` and `PUT` can actualy be used interchangably, but HTTP conventions recommend using them as described here.*

##DELETE
Removes the file at the specified URL.  This method requires authorization so requests must include a valid `x-access-key` or `x-access-token` header for the specified file.  If the token is not supplied or is invalid `401 unauthorized` is returend.  If the file does not exist `405 method not allowed` is returned.

###Example
Request:

     curl -X DELETE -H "x-access-token: 7092bee1ac7d4a5c55cb5ff61043b89a6e32cf71" "http://localhost:7302/music/Brinstar.mp3"

Response
`HTTP 206` if sucessful.

##HEAD
Returns status and header information for the specified URL.

###Example
Request:

    curl -I "http://localhost:7302/music/Brinstar.mp3"
